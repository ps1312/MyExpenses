# MyFinances

App made with Swift and UIKit to practice various topics:

- TDD
- Clean code
- Modular architecture
- UI creation in iOS

The goal in the end is to have an iOS application that help me to do one simple task:
**Track my expenses**

As for the technical side, the application should be made with _decoupled_ modules, in other words, the system should be _extendable_, _flexible_ and _plataform agnostic_ to promove reusability of code.
